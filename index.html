			<p>Hello! My name is Minhtri Tran, and I am an aspiring web developer.  I graduate on May 2016 with a BS Computer Science degree from <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">NYU Tandon School of Engineering</a>.  I am currently <span class="my-age"></span> years old.</p>
			
			<h2>Portfolio</h2>
			<h4>General Engineering</h4>
			<p>As the head of web development for the General Engineering department in my school, I manage their website.  My job is to improve it by fixing bugs and implementing new features.  It was built with PHP, JavaScript, SQL, CSS, and HTML.  2014 - 2016.  <a href="https://eg.poly.edu" target="_blank">eg.poly.edu</a></p>
			<h4>Emerald Doors</h4>
			<p>This was a contract job where I was tasked to fix their old website, which was filled with broken hyperlinks and improper styling.  I ended up rewriting their entire website.  It was built with just CSS and HTML (that was all I knew back then).  2011.  <a href="http://emeralddoorsnyc.com" target="_blank">emeralddoorsnyc.com</a></p>
